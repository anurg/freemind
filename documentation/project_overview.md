# FreeMind Task Tracker

## Project Overview
FreeMind is a task tracking application designed to help managers and team members keep track of official work assignments and progress. This platform allows tasks to be organized by predefined categories, assigned to specific team members or departments, and continuously monitored through detailed progress histories. The application is built to provide clear data-driven insights and timely notifications, ensuring that no task falls through the cracks.

The purpose of FreeMind is to streamline task management by combining robust data filtering, role-based user control, and AI-driven reports that generate summaries and insights. The key objectives are to ensure secure and authorized access, enable accurate tracking of tasks with complete histories, and provide managers with actionable analytics which include pending, completed, and delayed task metrics. Success will be measured by improved task oversight, enhanced communication through notifications, and efficient use of AI to complement human decision-making.
