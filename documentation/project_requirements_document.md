# Project Requirements Document (PRD) for FreeMind Task Tracker

## 1. Project Overview

FreeMind is a task tracking application designed to help managers and team members keep track of official work assignments and progress. This platform allows tasks to be organized by predefined categories, assigned to specific team members or departments, and continuously monitored through detailed progress histories. The application is built to provide clear data-driven insights and timely notifications, ensuring that no task falls through the cracks.

The purpose of FreeMind is to streamline task management by combining robust data filtering, role-based user control, and AI-driven reports that generate summaries and insights. The key objectives are to ensure secure and authorized access, enable accurate tracking of tasks with complete histories, and provide managers with actionable analytics which include pending, completed, and delayed task metrics. Success will be measured by improved task oversight, enhanced communication through notifications, and efficient use of AI to complement human decision-making.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

### In-Scope

*   **User Authentication & Role-Based Access Control**: Users must log in with valid credentials. A default admin user is provided for the initial setup, and only administrators can create and manage user accounts.
*   **Task Management**: Tasks can be created, updated, assigned to team members, and categorized based on predefined categories set by the admin. Users can track task progress by updating completion percentages and adding comments.
*   **Task Progress History**: All updates and comments will be recorded in a detailed timeline, allowing managers to view the evolution of each task.
*   **Data Tables with Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination**: Key task data will be presented in easily navigable tables with advanced filtering options.
*   **Notifications & Alerts**: In-app notifications and email alerts will be sent to users and managers regarding pending tasks, completed tasks, and task delays.
*   **Analytics and Reporting**: The dashboard will include visual representations such as charts and graphs that summarize tasks pending, completed, and delayed, along with AI-generated insightful reports and summaries.
*   **User Management**: Admins will have capabilities to create, edit, and deactivate user accounts.
*   **Audit Logs**: Detailed logs will track user actions, task updates, and comments for security and compliance.

### Out-of-Scope

*   **Self-Signup for Users**: There will be no public registration. Only the admin can create new user accounts.
*   **User-Created Task Categories**: Task categories will be managed exclusively by administrators.
*   **Real-Time Collaboration Tools**: Advanced collaboration features such as live chat or simultaneous editing are not included in the first version.
*   **Extensive Mobile-Specific Development**: While the dashboard is expected to be responsive, native mobile apps are not in scope for this release.
*   **Third-Party Integrations Beyond Email and In-App Notifications**: Integrations with external tools or platforms beyond the specified tech stack and email notification system are postponed for later phases.

## 3. User Flow

A typical user journey begins with a secure login page where credentials are entered. The application enforces role-based authentication, ensuring only authorized access. For first-time use, a default admin account (username: admin, password: admin) is provided so that an initial administrative setup can be completed. Once authenticated, the user is redirected to a personalized dashboard where the left navigation bar offers quick access to key sections such as Task Overview, Analytics, and User Management (if admin).

After the login, the user can view a comprehensive task overview in clear data tables that support filtering, sorting, and pagination. Managers can see both their tasks and tasks delegated to team members, while the detailed task pages allow users to update progress percentages and add comments. Notifications and alerts—both in-app and via email—keep all users informed of task updates, ensuring continuous oversight. This process ensures that every action is recorded, and the audit log is maintained automatically for security and accountability.

    *   Email notifications sent to both users and managers.

*   **Analytics and Reporting**

    *   Dashboards showcasing key metrics like tasks pending, completed, and delayed.
    *   Dynamic charts and graphs for easy visualization.
    *   AI-driven summaries and insights that highlight important trends and areas needing attention.

*   **AI-Driven Insights**

    *   Use of AI (GPT-4o or Claude 3.7 Sonnet) to generate summaries, insightful reports, and suggestions (e.g., auto-assign tasks or highlight tasks requiring attention).

*   **Audit Logs**

    *   Detailed tracking of all task updates, comments, and user actions for security and compliance.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   The initial login is provided by a default admin account, after which all new users are created by the admin.
*   Task categories are managed solely by the admin, ensuring consistency across the application.
*   The AI-driven component relies on the availability of GPT-4o or Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and performance may vary based on third-party model response times.
*   The application is designed to support multiple departments and overlapping tasks, assuming clear organizational structures are in place.
*   It is assumed that users will have basic familiarity with web applications and that no extensive training is required.
*   Email notifications require a reliable SMTP provider, and external dependencies should be monitored for rate limits or downtime.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **API Rate Limits**

    *   Potential rate limits from third-party AI services (GPT-4o or Claude 3.7 Sonnet) might delay report generation. Mitigation involves caching commonly requested summaries and implementing back-off strategies.

*   **User Management Accuracy**

    *   Ensuring that role-based access is accurately enforced is critical. Any misconfiguration can result in unauthorized access. Regular audits and thorough testing will help mitigate this.

*   **Data Synchronization and Performance**

    *   Handling large task histories and real-time updates might affect performance. Use of efficient querying, indexing in PostgreSQL, and implementing server-side pagination are recommended.

*   **Notification Reliability**

    *   The system relies on both in-app and email notifications. There might be delays or failures in email delivery, so it’s important to monitor notification status and have fallback procedures in place.

*   **Audit Logging Overhead**

    *   Maintaining detailed audit logs can consume storage and processing resources. A strategy for log archiving and cleanup may be needed as usage scales.
