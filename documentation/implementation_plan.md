**Implementation Plan for FreeMind Task Tracker**

Below is the step‑by‑step implementation plan organized by phases with exact instructions, file paths, and references to the PRD and supporting documents.

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1.  **Verify Node.js Installation:** Check if Node.js v20.2.1 is installed on your machine. If not, install Node.js v20.2.1. *(Tech Stack: Core Tools)*

2.  **Verify Python Installation:** Confirm Python 3.11.4 is available for any scripting tasks. *(Tech Stack: Core Tools)*

3.  **Initialize Git Repository:** Create a new directory (e.g., `freemind/`), initialize a Git repository, and create `main` and `dev` branches. *(PRD Section 1 & Tech Stack Document)*

4.  **Create Next.js 14 Project:** Run `npx create-next-app@14 --typescript` in the project directory. (Note: We use Next.js 14 precisely because it offers better integration with current AI coding tools and LLM models.) *(Tech Stack Document)*

5.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:** Within the Next.js project, install Tailwind CSS, shadcn/UI, Radix UI, and Lucide Icons.

    *   For Tailwind CSS, follow Tailwind’s installation guide;
    *   Install shadcn/ui and Radix UI as per their docs;
    *   Install Lucide Icons via npm. *(Frontend Guidelines Document)*

6.  **Set Up Prisma ORM:** Install Prisma via `npm install prisma --save-dev` and initialize it inside the project by running `npx prisma init`. Create the Prisma schema file at `/prisma/schema.prisma`. *(Tech Stack Document, Backend Structure Document)*

7.  **Configure PostgreSQL:** Set up a PostgreSQL instance (locally or via Docker). For Docker, run:

`docker run --name freemind-db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword -d postgres:15.3 `*(Tech Stack Document)*

1.  **Configure Environment Variables:** Create an `.env` file in the project root with values such as `DATABASE_URL` for PostgreSQL connectivity and any secret keys needed for JWT authentication. *(PRD Section 1 & Tech Stack Document)*
2.  **Validation:** Run `node -v` and `psql --version` (or check Docker container logs) to confirm that the correct versions are installed.

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

1.  **Design Login Page:** Create the login page at `/pages/login.tsx`. Include user interface elements for email and password. *(PRD Section 3, User Flow Document)*
2.  **Implement Role-based UI Behavior:** In `/pages/login.tsx`, ensure the logic supports a default admin login (username: admin, password: admin) and routing based on roles. *(PRD Section 3 & Core Features Document)*
3.  **Build Navigation and Dashboard Pages:** Create a dashboard page at `/pages/dashboard.tsx` that features an intuitive navigation bar and side menu that adapts based on user roles. *(PRD Section 3, App Flow Document)*
4.  **Develop Task Table Component:** Create a UI component at `/components/TaskTable.tsx` that renders task data in a table and supports filtering, sorting, and pagination. *(PRD Section 4 & Core Features Document)*
5.  **Implement Task Detail & History View:** Create `/pages/task/[id].tsx` where users can view detailed task information, update completion percentages, and add comments. Ensure that a timeline (progress history) of updates is displayed. *(PRD Section 4 & App Flow Document)*
6.  **Build Notifications Component:** Develop an in-app notification component at `/components/Notifications.tsx` to display alerts for pending, completed, or delayed tasks; integrate email alerts trigger logic later. *(PRD Section 4 & Core Features Document)*
7.  **Validation:** Run the development server (`npm run dev`) and manually check the login page, dashboard layout, and task table interactions.

## Phase 3: Backend Development

1.  **Implement Authentication API:** Create an API route at `/pages/api/auth/login.ts` to handle user login by verifying credentials against the PostgreSQL database using Prisma. *(PRD Section 1, Authentication and Role-Based Access)*
2.  **Set Up JWT Middleware:** Develop middleware (e.g., in `/utils/authMiddleware.ts`) that validates JWT tokens on protected routes. *(PRD Section 1, Security)*
3.  **Create User Management API:** Create API endpoints at `/pages/api/users/index.ts` for admin users to create, edit, and deactivate user accounts. Pre-populate the user table with a default admin account (username: admin, password: admin). *(PRD Section 1, User Management)*
4.  **Develop Task Management API:** Build API routes at `/pages/api/tasks/index.ts` (for CRUD operations on tasks) and `/pages/api/tasks/[id].ts` for task-specific operations (updates, progress history, comments). *(PRD Section 2 & Task Management and Categorization)*
5.  **Implement Audit Log Tracking:** In your backend logic (e.g., inside `/pages/api/tasks/` endpoints), log every action (task updates, comment submissions, user management changes) to an AuditLog table defined in `/prisma/schema.prisma`. *(PRD Section 6, Audit Logs)*
6.  **Set Up Notifications API:** Create an API endpoint at `/pages/api/notifications.ts` that triggers both in-app and email notifications using a reliable SMTP provider. *(PRD Section 4, Notifications and Alerts)*
7.  **Integrate AI-Driven Insights Endpoint:** Create an API route at `/pages/api/ai/insights.ts` which interacts with the chosen model (GPT-4o or Claude 3.7 Sonnet) to generate task summaries and insightful reports. *(PRD Section 4, AI-Driven Insights)*
8.  **Validation:** Use Postman or cURL to test each endpoint (login, user management, task CRUD, notifications, and AI insights) and ensure correct responses are returned.

## Phase 4: Integration

1.  **Connect Frontend to Authentication API:** In the frontend service layer (e.g., `/services/authService.ts`), implement API calls to `/api/auth/login.ts` to authenticate users and store JWT tokens. *(PRD Section 3, App Flow Document)*
2.  **Integrate Task APIs with Frontend:** In the dashboard and task detail pages, add API calls via a service file (e.g., `/services/taskService.ts`) that consumes `/api/tasks/` endpoints for fetching and updating tasks. *(PRD Section 3, Task Management and Categorization)*
3.  **Apply JWT Middleware on Frontend Requests:** Ensure that every API call from the frontend includes the JWT so that backend middleware properly verifies the session. *(PRD Section 1, Security)*
4.  **Integrate Notifications:** Link the notifications component to fetch alerts from `/api/notifications.ts` and display them in real time in the UI. *(PRD Section 4, Notifications and Alerts)*
5.  **Wire Up AI-Driven Insights:** In the dashboard’s analytics section, add functionality to call `/api/ai/insights.ts` and display the generated summaries/reports to users. *(PRD Section 4, AI-Driven Insights)*
6.  **Validation:** Perform an end-to-end test by logging in as the default admin, creating sample tasks, updating progress, and verifying that each update generates audit logs and notifications. Also test AI summaries by triggering the insights endpoint.

## Phase 5: Deployment

1.  **Prepare Production Build:** Run `npm run build` to generate a production build of the Next.js application. *(PRD Section 6, Performance & Reliability)*
2.  **Configure Environment for Deployment:** Ensure all environment variables (including `DATABASE_URL`, JWT secret, SMTP details) are correctly set in the deployment environment.
3.  **Set Up CI/CD Pipeline:** Configure GitHub Actions (or your chosen CI/CD tool) to automatically build and test the application on commits to the `dev` branch before merging to `main`. *(Tech Stack: Deployment)*
4.  **Deploy the Application:** Deploy the full application to your chosen cloud platform (e.g., Vercel for Next.js apps). Specify the hosting region as required (e.g., Vercel region `iad` if applicable). *(PRD Section 6, Deployment)*
5.  **Validation:** Access the production URL, perform a complete walkthrough (login, task creation, updates, notifications, AI insights), and use end‑to‑end tests (e.g., using Cypress) to ensure all functionalities are operating as expected.

This implementation plan meets the requirement specifications in the PRD and covers frontend, backend, integration, and deployment steps with strict adherence to the outlined tech stack and version requirements.
